 ## 1. Introduction
<p> <strong>OpenCart</strong> is free open source e-commerce platform for online merchants. The application provides a professional and reliable foundation from which to build a successful online store. This foundation appeals to a wide variety of users; ranging from <em>seasoned web developers</em> looking for a user-friendly interface to use, to <em>shop owners</em> just launching their business online for the first time. OpenCart has an extensive amount of features that gives you a strong hold over the customization of your store. With <strong>OpenCart</strong>'s tools, you can <em><strong>help your online shop live up to its fullest potential.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCart's administration</strong> side of the store is where you can <em><strong>modify features</em></strong>, <em><strong>upload images</em></strong>, <em><strong>add products</em></strong>, <em><strong>keep track of customers</em></strong>, <em><strong>manage payments</em></strong>, and much more. Customization in the admin affects how the customer will interact with a store: by modifying the look, structure, and content of the store front.</p>
